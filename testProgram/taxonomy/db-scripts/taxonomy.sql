Catch fish, frogs, crabs, insects... by stabbing them with long pointed bills. Body long, slim. Bills straight, cone-shaped. Wings long, broad and rounded. In flight: long & slender neck tucked back in an ''S'', not extended as storks, ibises and cranes. Sexes alike or very similar. Call: loud croaks and squawks. Most breed in colonies in trees and feed in the open.<br><br>BITTERNS: 12 species (4 ''Botaurus'', 8 ''Ixobrychus'') of subfamily ''Botarinae'', similar to herons in habits and habitat, although in general have shorter necks and legs. Plumage brown, yellow and black, variously striped and speckled. Solitary, inhabiting reedy and marshy places. At the approach of a potential predator, stand motionless with head up and neck vertical so that their brown-streaked plumage makes them almost indistinguishable from the surrounding reeds. Sluggish, and its flight slow and of short duration. When attacked, use both bill and claws for defense. Make a rude nest of sticks or reeds. 4-5 greenish-brown eggs. Diet: fish, frogs, crayfish, and other small swamp and marsh animals, speared by sharp-pointed bills. Occur almost worldwide.<br><br>EGRETS: various wading species, especially those having white plumage and bearing long, soft plumes on the lower parts of their backs during the breeding season. Some perform elaborate mating displays involving plumes. Typically frequent marshes, lakes, humid forests, and other wetland environments. Catch small fishes, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and crustaceans in shallow waters. They build large, untidy nests in trees and bushes or on the ground in large breeding colonies. <br><br>HERONS: about 60 species of wading birds of subfamily ''Ardeinaehave'' with elongated necks, legs, and bills. Bills, long, straight,  sharp edged, pointed. Wings broad. Has powder downs: areas of feathers that continually disintegrate to a fine powder used for preening (absorbing and removing fish oil, scum, and slime from the plumage).  Have four long-clawed toes on each foot, three directed forward, the fourth backward. Claw on the middle of forward toes has a rough, comblike inner margin used in preening. During breeding season many wear elongated plumes, variously on the head, back, or breast. Most construct loose, flat, platform-style nests high in branches of swamp trees; nests usually grouped in colonies. 2-6 pale blue eggs in a clutch. Most feed on aquatic animal life, but some eat insects and even mice. Most do not stalk their prey but, waiting in shallow water or on land, spear it with their long bills. Distributed worldwide but most common in tropics. Usually feed while wading quietly in shallow waters of pools, marshes, and swamps. Commonly stand with neck bent in S shape. Fly with legs trailing loosely and head held back against body, instead of stretching neck out in front as most birds do.<br><br>NIGHT HERONS form a nearly worldwide group of seven species of large-eyed nocturnal herons.',' ');

Differed from family ''Apodidae'' (swifts) by SHORTER, BROADER wings and MORE FLUTTERING flight. Plumage may be plain or marked with metallic blue or green; the sexes look alike in most species. Frequently PERCH in the open on branches or wires. Spend much time in the air, capturing insects on the wing; they are among the most agile of passerine birds. For nesting, may use a natural hollow or cranny in a tree, or excavate their own burrow into a sandbank, or plaster mud onto a wall or ledge to house three to seven white, sometimes speckled, eggs.

Omnivrous, feed in small parties, frequently with mixed species flocks. Many species rob the nests of other birds. Most build flimsy, untidy, cup-shaped nests, usually placed in trees. Sexes similar.<br><br>CROWS are black, found on every continent except South America and Antarctica. Are among the most intelligent and adaptable of birds; several species have been able to thrive near humans. Although territorial in the breeding season, are gregarious at other times; wintering flocks may number in the thousands. Even in the breeding season, gather together to mob owls and other predators. Crows in turn may be mobbed by other birds, because their omnivorous diet includes eggs and nestlings as well as other small animals, vegetable matter, carrion, and garbage. In some agricultural areas, are considered great pests, which accounts for the invention of the scarecrow. Nests are large platforms of sticks, usually in tall trees. The three to eight eggs are deeply colored and are incubated by the female. The young are cared for by both parents. Voices are loud and usually harsh, but are characteristic for each species.<br><br>JAYS AND MAGPIES are usually more brightly colored, shyer and inhabit mostly wooded country.',' ');

Fly with rapid wingbeats, interspersed with long glides. Plumage compact, dull or glossy gray, brown, or black, sometimes with pale or white markings on the throat, neck, belly, or rump.  Head broad, with short, wide, slightly curved bill. Tail, although often short, may be long and deeply forked. Feet tiny and weak; with the aid of sharp claws, used only to cling to vertical surfaces. A swift that lands on flat ground may be unable to regain the air. In soft-tailed forms, the hind toe is rotated forward as an aid in gripping vertical surfaces; in spine-tailed swifts, support is gained from the short needle-tipped tail feathers, and the feet are less modified. Catch insects on the wing. NEVER perch on trees or wires like swallows but with their short claws can only hang from vertical surfaces. Spend much of their time on the wing: grooming, copulating, and, in some species, apparently even sleeping in flight. Sensitive to weather conditions, large numbers often moving ahead of rainstorms to take advantage of feeding opportunities. Best identified when forced by bad weather to descend low or when drinking or bathing, skimming low over water surface. Larger swifts among fastest flying birds in the world. Sexes alike. Gregarious. Many species have screaming calls. Nest made of twigs, buds, moss, or feathers, glued with sticky saliva to the wall of a cave or the inside of a chimney, rock crack, or hollow tree. 1-6 white eggs (usually 2-3). Both eggs and young may be allowed to cool toward the environmental temperature in times of food scarcity, slowing development and conserving resources. Young stay in nest or cling near it for 6-10 weeks, depending largely on food supply. Upon fledging, they resemble the adults and immediately fly adeptly.<br><br>SWIFTLETS: Small size. Wings more rounded, narrow and slender; forked or notched tails. Rather fluttering flight. Tail only slightly notched rather than forked and appearing almost square-ended.

Weedy members of the family include dandelion, thistle, cocklebur, and ragweed, which is a major source of the airborne pollen that affects hay fever sufferers.<br>Often posses latex or oil passages. Common morphology: capitulum inflorescence with ray & disc florets (from a few to several thousand), both types are surrounded by bracts at the base, arranged in whorls or umbels; sessile pedicels, epigynous flowers, cypela fruits, carpels of basal placentation. Petals of the florets are fused along the base, forming a somewhat tubular corolla. Sepals vary in shapes but NEVER LEAF-LIKE: may be hair-like or scale-like, which often aid in distribution of seeds, or totally absent. Anthers are joined to form a tube through which the style (part of the female flower part) extends. The anthers release the pollen into the tube, and as the style elongates, it pushes the pollen upward out of the tube, making it available to insect pollinators or to wind dispersal. The stigmatic areas of the style are located on two branches of the style tip, and these branches separate after elongation. Thus, self-pollination is usually avoided, although in some cases the stigmatic branches recurve backward into the pollen-bearing anther tube. The single-ovary pistil bears the other flower parts on its apex. After fertilization it matures into a hard-coated single-seed fruit , often disseminated by wind thanks to a whorl of hairs (some umbrella-like).<br>Distr: cosmopolitan in almost all wild habitats and climates except for Antarctica; Vietnam from coasts to 3000 m.

Eyes small, compressed by the temporal & snot muscles, which are developed for shovelling through leaf mold and decaying vegetation in order to sniff out insects. Dentition is diagnostic for the family. Nervous, high-strung: respiration rate 850/min. and heart rate of 800 beats/min, increasing to 1200 beats/min. when alarmed. Although basically nocturnal, active almost continuously to search for sufficient food to maintain high body temperature and rapid metabolic rate. Diet is primarily insects, though will eat any small creature. Smallest shrews can starve to death in 8-12 hours, and eat as much as 3 times their body weight a day; largest shrews may eat their own weight a day. Most breed at least twice a year; litter size 2-10; gestation 16-35 days.

Several hundred new contemporary rose cultivars are introduced each year.<br>The classification of cultivated roses is complicated, because of the great numbers of cultivars involved and the amount of artificial hybridization that has taken place. Generally, the classes of old roses are based on selection from one or a few ancestral species or hybrids. Among the popular classes are the hybrid perpetuals, or remontant roses, which produce large, fragrant double flowers in early summer and fewer flowers in autumn, derived mainly from the hybrid species ''Rosa borboniana''. The class of polyantha roses includes many dwarf forms, with flowers produced in dense clusters, derived from the hybrid species ''Rosa rehderana''. Tea roses and China roses are old-rose classes from which the contemporary hybrid tea roses have been derived through hybridization with hybrid perpetual roses. Tea roses were derived from ''Rosa odorata''; and China roses from ''Rosa odorata'' and ''Rosa chinensis''. Hybrid tea roses are less hardy but more recurrent-blooming than the old hybrid perpetuals and contain a much wider variety of color and flower form.
